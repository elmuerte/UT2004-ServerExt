<h1>ServerExt</h1>
ServerExt is a package containing extentions for UT2004 servers. It consist out of a couple of independed components:
<ul>
	<li><a href="#playerjoinlog">Player join log</a></li>
	<li><a href="#servquery">ServQuery</a></li>
	<li><a href="#statschatlog">Stats chat log</a></li>	
	<li><a href="#mutrss">RSS Feed Mutator</a></li>
</ul>
More components will be added in the future. <br />
The ServerExt package is being developed by <a href="http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/ElMuerte">Michiel "El Muerte" Hendriks</a>. This is an unofficial add-on and not supported by Atari support.

<a name="servquery"></a><h1>ServQuery</h1>
ServQuery is a replacement for the default GameSpy query protocol that comes with UT2004. It adds quite some additional information, like team info, more detailed server information. And even the map list can be retrieved. <br />
For information about how to query a server using this interface refer to <a href="http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/UT_Server_Query" target="_blank">this UnrealWiki page</a>. There are some tools that use the extended features of ServQuery, these tools incluse: <a href="http://www.unrealza.co.za/proasm/ut2mon.html" target="_blank">UT2Monitor</a> and <a href="http://ut2003stats.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">UT Stats DB</a>.<br />
<br />
The following queries are added:
<h4><code>\about\</code></h4>
Returns about information, you can use this to check if a server has ServQuery installed, and what version.<br />
Reply:
<code>\about\ServQuery &lt;version&gt;\author\Michiel 'El Muerte' Hendriks\authoremail\elmuerte@drunksnipers.com\HighestRequestCount\&lt;count&gt;</code>

<h4><code>\bots\</code></h4>
Return information about the bots on the server<br />
Reply for each bot:
<code>\bot_&lt;id&gt;\&lt;bot name&gt;\ping_&lt;id&gt;\&lt;fake bot ping, if any&gt;</code>

<h4><code>\gamestatus\</code></h4>

<a name="statschatlog"></a><h1>Stats chat log</h1>
The standard stats logging that comes with UT2004 does not log the chats to the log file. This addon will enable chat logging into the stats log file. It will only log chats to the local log and does not disrupt the global logging. The logging is compatible with the old LocalLog and LocalStats chat logging.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Add <code>ServerExt.StatsChatLog</code> to the Server Actors list in your system configuration
<pre>
[Engine.GameEngine]
ServerActors=ServerExt.StatsChatLog
</pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
No configuration required

<hr />
<a name="mutrss"></a><h1>RSS Feed Mutator</h1>
The RSS Feed mutator is a replacement for the ServerAdsSE server addon for UT2003. It has the same functionality, with the major exception that it will retrieve the content from so called <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/docs/rss2.html" target="_blank">RSS Feeds</a>.<br />
A lot of sites and portal software provide a way to syndicate news via RSS files. This mutator allows you do display this news in the UT2004 game.

<h2>Installation</h2>
The mutator can either be installed as Mutator or as Server Actor. <br />
When installed as Server Actor you won't have the "mutate" functionality, and it won't show up in the mutator listing.<br />
There are two versions of this mutator available, one stores it's configuration in the UT2004.ini (system) file: <code>ServerExt.MutRSS</code> and the other stores it's configuration in the RSS.ini files: <code>ServerExt.MutRSSCentral</code>. <br />
If you run multiple servers and want the same configuration for all servers use the <code>ServerExt.MutRSSCentral</code> version.<br />
If you want to install this mutator the normal way (as a mutator) at it to the mutator list of your commandline: <code>?mutator=ServerExt.MutRSS</code><br />
If you want to install it as a Server Actor add <code>ServerExt.MutRSS</code> to the server actor list in the server configuration (UT2004.ini):
<pre>
[Engine.GameEngine]
ServerActors=ServerExt.MutRSS
</pre>
This mutator features a client side RSS Feed browser (only when installed as a mutator). If you want this function to be available you have to add the <code>ServerExtClient.u</code> and the <code>LibHTTP2.u</code> files to the ServerPackages list:
<pre>
[Engine.GameEngine]
ServerPackage=ServerExtClient
ServerPackage=LibHTTP2
</pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Mutator configuration</h3>
If you use <code>MutRSS</code> this configuration should go in the server's configuration (UT2004.ini), if you use <code>MutRSSCentral</code> it should be in RSS.ini<br />
Most of the configuration can also be set via the WebAdmin: defaults -> RSS Feeds<br />

<pre>

	<dd>Number of groups of message to display per broadcast</dd>

	<dt>iGroupSize</dt>

	a group size of n displays the the first min(n, length) entries starting
	from the selected index. The total number of lines displayed is:
	iBroadcastMessages * iGroupSize. When using BM_Linear you get the same result
	for iBroadcastMessages=1 ; iGroupSize=2 and iBroadcastMessages=2 ; iGroupSize=1</dd>

	<dt>sBroadcastFormat</dt>
	<dd>The format of the lines broadcasted. You can use the following replacements

	<dt>iDefUpdateInterval</dt>
	<dd>The default update interval of new RSS Feeds</dd>
</dl>

<h3>RSS Feed configuration</h3>
RSS Feeds can also be configured via the WebAdmin, using the "RSS Feeds" sub page next to the "current" and "default" links.<br />
All RSS Feeds are saved in the RSS.ini file. You can virtually have as many RSS Feeds as you want. Each feed has it's own configuration section. Each section starts with:
<pre>
[&lt;feed_name&gt; RSSFeedRecord]
</pre>
Where &lt;feed_name&gt; is a unique name of the feed. You may <b>not</b> use spaces in this name. However, this name will never be used when displaying information on screen (only in log files you will see this name again).<br />
Each feed has the following user configurable options:
<dl>
	<dt>rssHost</dt>
	<dd>The actual name of the feed. This will be used as fallback when it didn't receive the real name from the RSS feed.</dd>

	<dt>rssLocation</dt>
	<dd>The location to the RSS file</dd>

	<dt>rssEnabled</dt>
	<dd>True if this feed is enabled. Disabled feeds won't be used during broadcasting or updating.</dd>

	<dt>rssUpdateInterval</dt>
	<dd>Number of minutes between updates, don't set this too low. 45 minutes is a nice value. If this value is 0 the feed will never be updated, usefull for feeds that are not updated from a weblocation</dd>

	<dt>TextColor</dt>
	<dd>The color to use when showing the entries of this feed.<br />
	Format: <code>(R=0,G=255,B=255,A=255)</code></dd>
</dl>

After a feed has been updated the following additional entries will be saved to the RSS.ini file (for each feed). This information comes directly from the RSS files and should not be modified.

<dl>
	<dt>LastUpdate</dt>
	<dd>UNIX timestamp of the last update of the feed</dd>

	<dt>ChannelTitle</dt>
	<dd>Real title of the RSS Feed "channel"</dd>

	<dt>ChannelDescription</dt>
	<dd>Description of this channel</dd>

	<dt>ChannelLink</dt>
	<dd>Link to the homepage of this channel</dd>

	<dt>Entries</dt>
	<dd>These are the entries received from the RSS Feed file<br />
	It has the following format: <code>Entries=(Title=&lt;entry title&gt;,Link=&lt;entry link&gt;,Desc=&lt;entry description&gt;)</code><br />
</dl>
The package comes with a preconfigured RSS.ini file that contains configuration (disabled by default) for RSS feeds from:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.beyondunreal.com" target="_blank">Beyond Unreal</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unrealadmin.org" target="_blank">the Unreal Admin page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://games.slashdot.org" target="_blank">SlashDot: Games</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
When installed as a mutator, and bInteractive set to true, users can use the RSS Feeds at their request via the "mutate" command.<br />
All commands start with <code>mutate rss</code>, after which the following commands are accepted:
<table>
<tr>
	<td><code>help</code></td>
	<td>shows a help overview</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>browser</code></td>
	<td>show client side browser, if it's enabled</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>list</code></td>
	<td>show feed list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>show n [m]</code></td>
	<td>show m items from feed #n, m is 5 by default</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td colspan="2">Admin commands</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>start</code></td>
	<td>start the mutator, when it's disabled</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>stop</code></td>
	<td>stop the mutator</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>update n</code></td>
	<td>force an update on RSS feed #n</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>enable n</code></td>
	<td>enable RSS feed #n</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>disable n</code></td>
	<td>disable RSS feed #n</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>remove n</code></td>
	<td>remove RSS feed #n/td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>add name location</code></td>
	<td>add a new RSS feed with name and download location</td>
</tr>
</table>
